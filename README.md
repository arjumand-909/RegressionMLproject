# 📘 README.md – Insurance Charges Prediction Project

## 📌 1. Project Overview

This project aims to **predict medical insurance charges** based on individual demographic and health-related features such as **age, BMI, smoking status, children, etc.**

We use **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Multiple Machine Learning Regression Models** to build the best predictive model.

---

## 🎯 2. Problem Statement

Given a dataset of 1338 individuals with several personal and medical attributes, **predict the insurance cost (`charges`)** for each person.

---

## 📂 3. Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Feature  | Description                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| age      | Age of the person                |
| sex      | Gender (male/female)             |
| bmi      | Body Mass Index                  |
| children | Number of dependents             |
| smoker   | Smoking status                   |
| region   | Residential area                 |
| charges  | Insurance cost (Target Variable) |

Goal: **Build a model to accurately predict `charges`.**

## 📊 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (Why visuals matter)

| Visualization   | Purpose                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 📉 Histogram    | Check distribution & skewness          |
| 📦 Boxplot      | Detect outliers and spread             |
| 🎻 Violin Plot  | Compare distribution across categories |
| 🔵 Scatter Plot | Show relationships & smoking impact    |
| 🔁 Pairplot     | Holistic view of numeric interactions  |

These visuals helped us understand **data behavior** and **influential features**.

## 🛠️ 6. Data Preprocessing

✅ Checked data types
✅ Identified categorical vs numeric columns
✅ Converted `charges` using **log transformation** to fix skewness
✅ Handled potential hidden categorical/numeric columns
✅ Removed unnecessary columns

* `sex` and `region` had very low correlation with `charges` → dropped

---

## ♻️ 7. Feature Engineering

* Encoded categorical variable `smoker` using **LabelEncoder**
* Created **train-test split (80% train, 20% test)**
* Ensured data is ready for modeling

---

## 🔍 8. Correlation Analysis & Feature Selection

* Calculated correlation map using `.corr()`
* Visualized using **Heatmap**
* Found **Smoking and Age** strongly impact charges
* Dropped low-impact features

## 🤖 9. Machine Learning Models Used (7 Regressors)

We trained and compared **7 regression algorithms:**

1. **Linear Regression** – Simple baseline model
2. **Decision Tree Regressor** – Handles non-linear data
3. **Random Forest Regressor** – Reduces overfitting, ensemble method
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor** – Powerful, sequential learning
5. **KNN Regressor** – Instance-based learning
6. **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** – Works well for complex boundaries
7. **(Optional) XGBoost Regressor** – Advanced boosting (if installed)

Each model was trained using the same dataset and preprocessing steps.

---

## 📏 10. Evaluation Metrics Used (7 Metrics Explained)

To measure model performance, we used:

✅ **R² Score (Accuracy %)** – How well model explains variance
✅ **MAE** – Average absolute prediction error
✅ **MSE** – Penalizes large errors (squared)
✅ **RMSE** – Standard deviation of errors (easier to interpret)
✅ **Prediction vs Real Value** – Sample evaluation
✅ **Model Comparison Table** – To select the best performer
✅ **Interpretation of outputs** – Explained results clearly

---

## 🏆 11. Best Model Selected

**✅ Gradient Boosting Regressor** performed the best.

**Performance:**

* **R² Score:** ~85%
* **Low MAE & RMSE**
* **Predictions very close to actual values**

It handled both linear & non-linear relationships effectively.

## 🔑 12. Key Insights from Data

✅ Smoking has the strongest impact on charges
✅ Age also highly influences cost
✅ BMI shows moderate effect
✅ Children have minor impact
✅ Sex and region have almost no effect
✅ Log transformation improved normality

---

## ✅ 13. Final Conclusion

✔ The problem of predicting insurance charges has been successfully solved
✔ Gradient Boosting Regressor is the most reliable model
✔ Data preprocessing and feature selection improved accuracy
✔ Model can now predict charges for **new individuals** with high confidence
